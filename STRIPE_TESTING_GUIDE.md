## Phase 4: Webhook Testing

Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your app about subscription events.

### Option A: Manual Testing (Production Only)

Skip to Phase 5 - webhooks will work once deployed to production.

### Option B: Local Webhook Testing with Stripe CLI

#### Install Stripe CLI

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases

**Linux:**
```bash
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.19.0/stripe_1.19.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf stripe_1.19.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin
```

#### Configure Webhook Forwarding

1. Login to Stripe CLI:
```bash
stripe login
```

2. Forward webhooks to your local server:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

3. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)

4. Update `.env.local`:
```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
```

5. Restart your dev server

#### Test Webhook Events

1. In a new terminal, trigger test events:

```bash
# Test successful checkout
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Test subscription created
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

# Test subscription canceled
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted

# Test payment failed
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
```

2. Watch your server logs for webhook events
3. Check Supabase to verify profile updates

**What to Check:**
- ‚úÖ Webhook events appear in server console
- ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed` upgrades user to premium
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.deleted` downgrades to free
- ‚úÖ Profile updates in Supabase database

## Phase 5: Verify Database Updates

After each payment test, check Supabase:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unzikrmweevksqxllpnv/editor)
2. Click "Table Editor" ‚Üí "profiles"
3. Find your test user
4. Verify these fields:

| Field | Expected Value |
|-------|---------------|
| `plan` | "premium" (after payment) or "free" (after cancel) |
| `subscription_start_date` | ISO timestamp of when premium started |
| `stripe_customer_id` | Starts with `cus_` |
| `stripe_subscription_id` | Starts with `sub_` |
| `has_used_trial` | `true` (after first trial) |

## Phase 6: Test User Experience Flows

### Flow 1: Complete Trial Journey

Day 1-7 (Trial Period):
- [ ] User has full premium access
- [ ] No charges yet
- [ ] Can cancel anytime

Day 8 (Trial Ends):
- [ ] Stripe charges ¬£14.99
- [ ] Subscription becomes active
- [ ] User continues with premium access

### Flow 2: Subscription Management

- [ ] User can view subscription in profile
- [ ] Can cancel subscription (implement cancel flow)
- [ ] After cancellation, access continues until period end

### Flow 3: Payment Failure Handling

- [ ] Card expires or fails
- [ ] Stripe sends `invoice.payment_failed` webhook
- [ ] User receives notification (to implement)
- [ ] User can update payment method

## Phase 7: Production Readiness Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Switch from test keys to **live keys** in Vercel
- [ ] Set up production webhook at `https://www.jimbula.co.uk/api/webhooks/stripe`
- [ ] Test with real card (small amount)
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Add subscription management UI in profile
- [ ] Test refund process
- [ ] Configure Stripe tax settings (if needed)
- [ ] Set up Stripe Billing Portal for customer self-service

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Stripe is not configured" error

**Solution:**
- Check `.env.local` has correct keys

### Issue: Payment succeeds but user not upgraded

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Trial not working

**Solution:**
- Check `has_used_trial` field in Supabase profiles table
