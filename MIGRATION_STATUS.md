# Supabase Migration Status

## ✅ Completed

### Phase 1: Setup & Configuration
- ✅ Installed Supabase packages (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`)
- ✅ Created `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials
- ✅ Created Supabase client utilities:
  - `/src/lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser client)
  - `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (server client with admin privileges)

### Phase 2: Database Schema
- ✅ Created comprehensive database schema in `/supabase/schema.sql`
- ✅ Includes 16 tables with Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Auto-creates profile on user signup via trigger

### Phase 3: Authentication Migration
- ✅ **Migrated AuthContext** from localStorage to Supabase Auth
- ✅ All authentication methods now use Supabase:
  - `register()` - Creates Supabase user + profile with 7-day trial
  - `login()` - Uses Supabase authentication
  - `logout()` - Signs out from Supabase
  - `resetPassword()` - Sends real password reset email via Supabase
  - `updatePassword()` - Updates password in Supabase
  - `updateProfile()` - Updates profile in Supabase database
  - `upgradeToPremium()` - Updates plan in Supabase database

### Phase 4: Stripe Integration
- ✅ **Updated Stripe webhook** to write to Supabase instead of localStorage
- ✅ Stores `stripe_customer_id` and `stripe_subscription_id` in profiles table
- ✅ Automatically upgrades/downgrades users based on Stripe events
- ✅ Handles subscription lifecycle (created, updated, deleted, payments)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Must Do This Now

### Run the Database Schema in Supabase

**Your app will NOT work until you do this:**

1. Open `/supabase/schema.sql` (600+ lines)
2. Copy ALL the SQL
3. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unzikrmweevksqxllpnv/sql/new
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. Verify tables were created in **Table Editor**

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (localStorage):
- All user data stored in browser
- Cleared when cache is cleared
- No cross-device sync
- Fake authentication
- Stripe payments not properly tracked

### After (Supabase):
- **Real authentication** with Supabase Auth
- **PostgreSQL database** for all user data
- **Cross-device sync** - login from anywhere
- **Proper security** with Row Level Security
- **Stripe subscriptions** properly tracked
- **Data persists forever** (with backups)

---

## 📝 What Still Uses localStorage

Currently still using localStorage (will migrate next):
- ❌ Boards/Tasks data
- ❌ Finance transactions
- ❌ Ideas boards
- ❌ Calendar events
- ❌ Theme preferences

These will be migrated in the next phases.

## 🧪 Testing the Authentication

Once you run the schema, test the auth flow:

### 1. Register a New Account
- Go to http://localhost:4000/auth
- Click "Sign Up"
- Fill in: email, password, first name, last name
- Submit
- You should be redirected to dashboard

### 2. Check Supabase Dashboard
- Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
- You should see your new user
- Go to **Table Editor** → **profiles**
- You should see your profile with trial dates

### 3. Logout and Login
- Logout from the app
- Login again with same credentials
- Should work seamlessly

### 4. Test Password Reset
- Click "Forgot Password"
- Enter your email
- Check your email inbox for reset link
- Click link and set new password

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (After Running Schema)

After you confirm authentication is working:

1. **Migrate Boards/Tasks** - Create Supabase service layer for boards
2. **Migrate Finance** - Move transactions to Supabase
3. **Migrate Ideas** - Move ideas boards to Supabase
4. **Migrate Calendar** - Move events to Supabase
5. **Migrate Theme** - Move preferences to Supabase
6. **Create Migration Tool** - Help users move existing localStorage data

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ RLS policies protect user data (users can only see their own data)
- ✅ Service role key only used in server-side API routes
- ✅ Passwords hashed by Supabase (never stored in plain text)
- ✅ Session managed by Supabase (secure HTTP-only cookies)
- ⚠️ Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in client code

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

**Core Tables:**
- `profiles` - User profiles with plan, trial dates, Stripe IDs
- `user_preferences` - Currency, theme settings
- `boards`, `columns`, `swimlanes`, `tasks`, `subtasks`, `comments` - Task management
- `finance_transactions` - Income/expenses
- `idea_boards`, `idea_sections`, `idea_notes`, `idea_collaborators`, `idea_comments` - Ideas
- `calendar_events` - Calendar entries

**All tables have RLS enabled** - users can only access their own data.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" errors
- Check Supabase project is not paused
- Verify environment variables are correct
- Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`

### RLS policy errors
- Make sure you ran the full `schema.sql`
- Check user is logged in (RLS requires authenticated user)

### Auth not working
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check Supabase Auth is enabled in dashboard
- Verify email provider is enabled

### Data not saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify RLS policies were created
- Check Supabase logs in dashboard

## ✨ Ready to Test!

Once you run the schema, the authentication system is fully functional with Supabase! 🎉

Try registering a new account and see your data appear in the Supabase dashboard.
